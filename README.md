## Framework
Phaser 3 was the chosen framework for the development of this game. Phaser 3 is the new version of the Phaser Game Framework series. It includes a brand-new custom WebGL renderer designed specifically for the needs of modern 2D games. Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and automatically switch between them based on browser support.

## Prerequisites
You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

For Windows users there is [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Install Node.js and `npm` with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Replace 'node' with 'latest' for `nvm-windows`.

Then install Parcel:

```bash
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

## Start development server

```
npm install
```

```
npm run start
```

#### Problem Description

The student was assigned the task to remake ZX Spectrum Jetpac in JavaScript. Jetpac is a shooter video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game and released for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore VIC-20 in 1983 and the BBC Micro in 1984.

The game world is presented in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in pieces scattered around the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated with alternate procedures. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.

After the first level, the rocket stays assembled and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement has to be built before it can be refuelled for takeoff. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the core gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner

The remake version of the original game differs a little bit in one area from the original. There are infinite number of levels and complexity grows significantly (enemy movement pattern changes) on every even level excluding level one. Score multiplier is determined depending on current level and enemy complexity. Extra live is granted on each level up.
